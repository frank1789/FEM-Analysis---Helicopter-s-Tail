 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      29.328   TIME= 19:52:10
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =      29.344   TIME= 19:52:10

 ELEMENT TYPE    1 IS BEAM189 . KEYOPT(1)=1 IS SUGGESTED FOR NON-CIRCULAR CROSS
 SECTIONS.

 ELEMENT TYPE    1 IS BEAM189 . KEYOPT(15) IS ALREADY SET AS SUGGESTED.

 ELEMENT TYPE    2 IS SHELL181. IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH ELASTOPLASTIC 
 MATERIALS ONLY. KEYOPT(8)=2 IS SUGGESTED AND KEYOPT(3)=2 IS SUGGESTED FOR
 HIGHER ACCURACY OF MEMBRANE STRESSES; OTHERWISE, KEYOPT(3)=0 IS SUGGESTED.

 Predictor is ON by default for structural elements with rotational      
 degrees of freedom.  Use the PRED,OFF command to turn the predictor     
 OFF if it adversely affects the convergence.
