\chapter{Tail rotor}
In this chapter we analyze the tail rotor in condition decoupled from rest of the structure because in this way it's possible observe in detail the behaviour when is performed a modal analisys and a transient analisys.
In the following the tail rotor will be attached at the rest of the structure thanks to  the macro realized both for the truss model and for the shell model.
