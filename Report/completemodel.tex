\chapter{Complete Model}
Now describe the procedure to attach the tail rotor to two structure: the truss model and shell model, respectively.
In both base model we add a part that realize the nodes that represent rigid link between the tail structure and tail rotor.
After call the macro to realize the component, realized connection by rigid elements between these and component previous realized, thus you can obserse the result in figure.
